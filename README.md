# Statistics
These studies are about various topics in statistics, including mathematical derivations of key statistical conclusions and their applications, implementation using Python code, and case studies based on simulations.

## 1. Some important concepts in statistics
- Central Limit Theorem
- Distribution
- ### Estimations and Confidence Interval Three Solutions to Calculate Confidence Interval
- Delta Method
- Bayes Estimate

## 2. Hypothesis testing
- Wald Test and Likelihood Ratio Test
- Case Study: Hypothesis Testing Example with a Uniform Distribution
- Two Sample Test
- From Wald Test to  Student's t test (T test)
- Multiple Hypothesis Testing (i.e. simultaneously testing multiple hypotheses)
- Goodness of Fitness Tests

## 3. Linear Regression
- Joint Distribution
- Linear Regression: Estimate and T Test
